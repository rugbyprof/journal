For an open-source embedded IDE that allows students to **compile and run C++ code** and **run Python code**, there are several options that you can self-host or embed within a web-based platform. Here's a list of open-source solutions that you can explore, along with some considerations for how they can be used in a classroom environment:

### 1. **Theia (Eclipse)**
   - **Description**: Theia is an open-source, extensible cloud and desktop IDE developed by the Eclipse Foundation. It's designed to be similar to Visual Studio Code.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Supports **C++** and **Python** development with extensions.
     - You can embed Theia in a web-based platform for your students.
     - Offers real-time collaboration and cloud-based environments.
     - Highly customizable and supports various languages and frameworks.
   - **Self-hosting**: You can host Theia on your own servers or cloud environments like AWS, Azure, etc.

### Recommended Approach:

1. **Judge0 IDE or Theia** would be good starting points if you're looking for a flexible, open-source IDE that supports both **C++** and **Python** and can be embedded into a web-based platform. 
   
2. **JupyterLab** with the **xeus-cling** kernel provides a great interactive environment for **Python** and **C++**, especially if you're interested in a notebook-style interface.

3. **CodeMirror** would be a lightweight option if you want to build your own platform and integrate with backend services for code execution.

### Key Considerations:
- **Security**: Be mindful of security concerns, especially when hosting compilers and interpreters. Running code on a server can expose your infrastructure to malicious attacks if not properly sandboxed.
- **Scalability**: Consider the number of students using the IDE simultaneously, and ensure the platform is scalable (e.g., Docker containers or Kubernetes can help).
- **Ease of Use**: Ensure the IDE provides a smooth experience for students to write, compile, and debug code.
