To solve the problem of finding two numbers in an array that add up to a predetermined value in better than \(O(n^2)\), you can use a **hash map (or dictionary)** to achieve an **\(O(n)\)** time complexity solution. The algorithm that makes use of a hash map is efficient and faster than the brute-force \(O(n^2)\) approach.

### Problem:
You are given an array of integers, and you need to find two distinct numbers that sum up to a given target value. The same element cannot be used twice.

### Hash Map (Dictionary) Approach (Time Complexity: \(O(n)\)):

#### Steps:
1. **Iterate through the array**: For each number in the array, calculate the difference between the target value and the current number (let's call this the complement).
2. **Check the hash map**: For each number, check if its complement already exists in the hash map. If it does, you have found the two numbers that add up to the target.
3. **Store numbers in the hash map**: If the complement is not found in the hash map, store the current number in the hash map with its value as the key.

### Algorithm:

1. Create an empty hash map (dictionary).
2. Iterate through each element `x` in the array:
   - Calculate `complement = target - x`.
   - Check if `complement` exists in the hash map.
     - If it does, return the pair `x` and `complement`.
     - Otherwise, store `x` in the hash map as a key.
3. If the loop ends without finding the pair, return no solution.

### Example:
```python
def find_two_sum(nums, target):
    # Create a dictionary to store the numbers we have seen
    seen = {}
    
    # Iterate over the array
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        # Calculate the complement of the current number
        complement = target - num
        
        # If the complement exists in the hash map, we found the pair
        if complement in seen:
            return (complement, num)
        
        # Otherwise, store the current number in the dictionary
        seen[num] = i
    
    # If no pair is found
    return None

# Example usage:
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9
result = find_two_sum(nums, target)
print(result)  # Output: (2, 7)
```

### Explanation:
- We iterate over the array, and for each element, we compute the complement (i.e., the number that would sum with the current element to give the target).
- We check if this complement exists in the hash map. If it does, we have found the pair.
- Otherwise, we store the current element in the hash map and continue.

### Time Complexity:
- **Time complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the array. Each element is processed once, and hash map operations (insert and lookup) take constant time.
- **Space complexity**: \(O(n)\), as we store each element in the hash map.

This approach is efficient and guarantees \(O(n)\) performance compared to the \(O(n^2)\) brute-force solution.
